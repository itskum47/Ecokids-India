## THE PITCH (30 SECONDS)

EcoKids India is a NEP 2020-compliant gamified platform that transforms environmental education from exam-focused theory into **verified behavioral change**—costing ₹120-160 per student annually, with built-in child safety and offline capability for all rural schools.

---

## THE PROBLEM (BULLET POINTS)

- 78% of students forget environmental concepts within 6 months
- Zero behavioral change measured (students don't change habits)
- 62% of rural schools have poor/no internet
- Teachers lack real-time student engagement data
- **Result:** Billions spent on education with no environmental impact

---

## THE SOLUTION (3 PILLARS)

### 1️⃣ LEARN
Interactive lessons in 8 Indian languages (works offline)

### 2️⃣ ACT
Real-world eco-tasks (plant trees, segregate waste, save water)

### 3️⃣ VERIFY
Photo proof + teacher approval + government audit = behavioral change
