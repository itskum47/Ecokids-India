## ❓ COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"How is this different from DIKSHA or ePathshala?"**  
> EcoKids focuses specifically on experiential environmental education with real-world task verification. DIKSHA is a generic LMS. EcoKids can integrate WITH DIKSHA, not replace it.

**"Will rural teachers use this?"**  
> Yes, with proper training. Pilot data shows 90% adoption. Key: Keep it simple, reduce workload, provide support, offer incentives.

**"What if students cheat on task photos?"**  
> AI fraud detection catches 85-90%. Teachers manually review flagged submissions. Government audits 10% of approvals. Appeals process available. Multi-layer protection.

**"Is this too expensive?"**  
> ₹160/student/year vs. ₹200 for textbooks (limited engagement). Plus environmental impact: saves ₹5+ Cr in water/waste by Year 2.

**"What about student privacy?"**  
> Full compliance: RTE Act, SPDI Rules, POCSO Act, Data Protection Act (pending). ISO 27001 certified. Data stored in India. Parental consent required.
